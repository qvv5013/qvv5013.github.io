abstract = {Proteins and nucleic acids can phase-separate in the cell to form concentrated biomolecular condensates1–4. The functions of condensates span many length scales: they modulate interactions and chemical reactions at the molecular scale5, organize biochemical processes at the mesoscale6 and compartmentalize cells4. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of these processes will require detailed knowledge of the rich dynamics across these scales7. The mesoscopic dynamics of biomolecular condensates have been extensively characterized8, but their behaviour at the molecular scale has remained more elusive. Here, as an example of biomolecular phase separation, we study complex coacervates of two highly and oppositely charged disordered human proteins9. Their dense phase is 1,000 times more concentrated than the dilute phase, and the resulting percolated interaction network10 leads to a bulk viscosity 300 times greater than that of water. However, single-molecule spectroscopy optimized for measurements within individual droplets reveals that at the molecular scale, the disordered proteins remain exceedingly dynamic, with their chain configurations interconverting on submicrosecond timescales. Massive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations reproduce the experimental observations and explain this apparent discrepancy: the underlying interactions between individual charged side chains are short-lived and exchange on a pico- to nanosecond timescale. Our results indicate that, despite the high macroscopic viscosity of phase-separated systems, local biomolecular rearrangements required for efficient reactions at the molecular scale can remain rapid.},

abstract = {TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is involved in key processes in RNA metabolism and is frequently implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. The prion-like, disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of TDP-43 is aggregation-prone, can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in isolation, and is critical for phase separation (PS) of the full-length protein under physiological conditions. While a short conserved helical region (CR, spanning residues 319-341) promotes oligomerization and is essential for LLPS, aromatic residues in the flanking disordered regions (QN-rich, IDR1/2) are also found to play a critical role in PS and aggregation. Compared with other phase-separating proteins, TDP-43 CTD has a notably distinct sequence composition including many aliphatic residues such as methionine and leucine. Aliphatic residues were previously suggested to modulate the apparent viscosity of the resulting phases, but their direct contribution toward CTD phase separation has been relatively ignored. Using multiscale simulations coupled with in vitro saturation concentration (csat) measurements, we identified the importance of aromatic residues while also suggesting an essential role for aliphatic methionine residues in promoting single-chain compaction and LLPS. Surprisingly, NMR experiments showed that transient interactions involving phenylalanine and methionine residues in the disordered flanking regions can directly enhance site-specific, CR-mediated intermolecular association. Overall, our work highlights an underappreciated mode of biomolecular recognition, wherein both transient and site-specific hydrophobic interactions act synergistically to drive the oligomerization and phase separation of a disordered, low-complexity domain.}}
