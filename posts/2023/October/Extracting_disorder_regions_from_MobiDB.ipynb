    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins are complex biomolecules crucial for the functioning of living organisms. They come in various shapes and sizes, each designed for specific functions within cells. Some proteins are well-structured, while others exhibit intrinsic disorder. Understanding the level of disorder in a protein is essential for unraveling its biological role. In this blog post, we'll explore how we can determine if a protein is fully intrinsically disordered, contains structured regions with disordered loops, or is entirely structured, using insights from Necci et al.'s 2016 research (@Necci2016).\n",
    "Given a protein sequence and structural ensemble, how do we know if it is fully IDP, protein with some IDR regions or it is fully structured with some loops?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classifying Proteins Based on Disorder:\n",
    "\n",
    "Necci and colleagues proposed a classification scheme for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) based on the number of consecutive disordered residues:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Short IDR: Proteins with $5-19$ consecutive disordered residues.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Long IDR: Proteins with 20 or more consecutive disordered residues.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Fully Disordered Protein: Proteins with 50 or more consecutive disordered residues and more than 95% of their content being disordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classification scheme provides a straightforward way to categorize proteins based on their disorder characteristics, offering valuable insights into their potential functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mapping Sequence Features:\n",
    "To determine a protein's disorder characteristics, we need to map sequence features from two primary resources: DISPROT and MobiDB. DISPROT is a database that provides information about where structured and disordered regions are located in a protein sequence, while MobiDB offers valuable data on protein mobility and disorder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these resources, we can efficiently evaluate the disorder characteristics of a given protein entry in the PED (Protein Ensemble Database). By cross-referencing the information from DISPROT and MobiDB with the PED entries, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of a protein's structural properties.\n"

    "# What is MobiDB?\n",
    "MobiDB comprises different types of disorder annotations and different quality levels of disorder evidence. (More information can be found here: @Monzon2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "The source of evidence in MobiDB can be classified depending on the quality of evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <b>High-quality:</b> data are imported from manually curated external databases. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. <b>Intermediate-quality:</b> annotations are derived from experimental data such as X-ray diffraction, NMR, and NMR chemical shifts. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. <b>Lowest-quality:</b> Disorder predictions are provided by different computational methods and represent the lowest quality and confidence, even though they have by far the largest coverage by including all UniProt proteins\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>In order to provide the most reliable disorder annotation for each protein, MobiDB combines all its data sources into a consensus annotation, prioritizing curated and indirect pieces of evidence over predictions.</u>"

    "<b>Curated Data:</b> High-quality annotations in MobiDB come from external resources which provide manually curated evidence. Intrinsically disordered regions are extracted from three databases, DisProt, FuzDB, and UniProt.\n",
    "DisProt is the largest database which covers manually curated ID annotations. In the latest version of MobiDB, DisProt disordered regions are propagated by homology, exploiting GeneTree alignments with a similarity constraint of 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Derived Data:</b> Indirect experimental data sources provide annotations from X-ray experiments, NMR three-dimensional models, and NMRchemical shift data. Indirect disorder information is derived from PDB in three different ways by considering (1) missing, (2) high temperature, and (3) mobile residues. Missing residues are those for which the detected electron density is not sharp enough to model the corresponding structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Predicted Data:</b> To define a residue as disordered, at least five out of eight predictors have to agree with the prediction."
