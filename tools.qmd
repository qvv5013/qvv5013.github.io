# entanglement Analysis

There are two main version of entanglement analysis:

* The first one is characterized by the linking number of loops and the open terminal, which is composed of the whole terminal. Please check this paper for more details. This kind of entanglement can be calculated by the following code which is developed by Ian Sitarik (Penn State).
[Python version]()


* The maximum linking number between the loop and all possible segments of the terminal is calculated by the following code: [Julia version](https://github.com/qvv5013/entanglement_analysis).
There are two versions for this kind of entanglement calculation, in python and Julia. julia is much faster than Python.
